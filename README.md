# Ceramix_co
I have recently completed a front-end web development project for Ceramic Co., a ceramics company. This website is entirely built using HTML and CSS, showcasing the company's ceramic products and offering various features to enhance the user experience.Any claim of ownership by someone other than myself would be unfounded.
